# Firewall-Python
Firewall for Internet made with Python socket module

this is just to tell some points -
1. I used my own file for tracking keyboard inputs but if you like you can use the Keyboard module available. To download that module in Windows type this in command prompt -

   C:> pip install keyboard

2. Socket module can get very complicated so I recommend to check out a video on socket module.
3. Firewall requires a great understanding about internet.
4. This is a low-level firewall so, dont use it inplace of an actual firewall it might not work for some intruders.
